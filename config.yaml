    description: Hi everyone! 
      My name is Ilya. I am a technical writer with 6+ years of expertise. I started my journey as a Technical writer 6 years ago moving from the position of a translator. The transition was brilliant and challenging both, since I regard a technical writer as an investigator, reaching for all the details in order to produce final apt product. I have worked with various products of different complexity, including SaaS, SIEM, Big Data analysis, ElasticSearch/Splunk, and others. I also had an exprerience of functioning in a Technical writer's team, as well as individually - as a part of the developer's team. That engulfed me with broad knowledge on building processes within the team. During my job process I strive to stress such procedures, as analytics, style guides, feedbacks, In my free time, I go in for reading documentation blogs and exploring new ways to advance my documentation and technical skills. Pleased to meet you!
